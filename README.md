### Hi there 😁

Passionate about programming and always looking for the best game development technologies, web and mobile, I became a developer. 👨‍💻

I graduated in digital games technician at SENAI in 2018, where I developed a large part of my knowledge in the C # language on the Unity3D engine, throughout the course I had the opportunity to intern at Blue Pixel as a QA. 🎮

Curiosity and interest define me, now in 2020 to update myself with the most modern web and mobile development technologies, I started the Rocketseat GoStack course in order to master a powerful Stack with Node on the back end, React on the web and React Native on mobile, using the JavaScript language with TypeScript.💻
